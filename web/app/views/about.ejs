                <p>After graduating from the University of Nottingham with a degree in Zoology in 2008 I started a career in wildlife conservation. More recently I have turned to my other passion, words and the English language, a change which has been precipitated by illness and the need to do something more sedentary.</p>
                <p>While I still keep up with my interest in the natural world&mdash;my bookshelf is stuffed with species identification books and I am part of the management team of a local conservation group&mdash;I now work as a proofreader.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy the challenge of searching for and correcting mistakes in a piece of writing&mdash;I find thereâ€™s something innately satisfying about ensuring that a text has no errors within it that will distract the reader. I relish figuring out how grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors can be rectified. The wildlife books now compete for space with English language reference books!</p>
